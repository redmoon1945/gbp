/**
 * Specify a Growth Pattern, that is, how an inital amount changes over time. The pattern is built using one or more
 * "Growth value", expressed in annual percentage, ranging from -100% to 10000%.
 * Internally, the cummulative effect of successive growth values applied through time is captured in a
 * "cummulative growth factor" (CGF). At any time, the current value of the CGF can be multiplied by the initial amount
 * in order to get the "growth adjusted" value of the initial amount at that moment.
 *
 * Growth is always APPLIED on a MONTHLY basis (consequently, growth value cannot change within a single month).
 * However, for conveniance purpose, growth values are always SPECIFIED on an "annual base", which means that this
 * class internally convert theses values to monthly basis for calculation purpose.  Growth is always applied on
 * Day 1 of the month concerned.
 *
 * Growth values are internally always defined and persisted as decimal number (qint64), in order to keep an exact
 * representation of the growth value (which is not possible with a double). This means we also need to remember
 * the number of decimals used in the decimal values for conversion to double value. For example, if the qint64
 * holds 12345, with a no of decimals = 3, it means the value stores represents exactly 12.345 %. With no of decimals
 * = 5, the value represents 0.12345%
 *
 * There are 2 options available to define a growth pattern :
 * -> CONSTANT GROWTH :
 *        A constant annual growth value, that applies from -infinity to +infinity. For example, with a annual
 *        growth value of 5%, applied to an amount of 1000 starting to exist on 1 jan 2000, we have :
 *            1 jan 2000 : 1000 (growth does not apply on the first month of existence)
 *            1 feb 2000 : 1004.74 (1 month of monthly growth of 0.40741238%, CFG is now 1.0040741238)
 *            1 jan 2001 : 1050 (CGF is now = 1.05)
 *            1 jan 2002 : 1102.50 (CGF is now = 1.05 * 1.05 =  1.1025)
 * -> VARIABLE GROWTH :
 *        A set of (date, annual growth value) "pairs", each defining a new growth value to be applied
 *        from this date, until a new pair is defined or otherwise for ever.
 *        Before the first pair is defined, growth value is 0 (CGF is 1). Each time a new pair is defined,
 *        a new growth value becomes in force from that date.
 *        For example, lets say we have the following pairs defined :  (1 jan 2000, 10%) , (1 jan 2002, -10%).
 *        Here are the values of an amount of 1000 that starts existing on 1 jan 1998 and is submitted to this growth pattern:
 *            1 jan 1999 : 1000 (growth = 0%, CFG = 1)
 *            1 jan 2000 : 1100 (new growth value=10%, CGF is now = 1 + 10% = 1.1)
 *            1 jan 2001 : 1210 (growth value still at 10%, CFG is now = 1.1 + 10% = 1.21)
 *            1 jan 2002 : 1089 (new growth value=-10%, CFG is now = 1.21 - 10% = 1.089)
 *            1 jan 2003 : 980.10 (growth still at -10%, CFG is now = 1.089 - 10% = 0.9801)
 *        If the amount of 1000 starts existing on 1 jan 2003, then we have
 *            1 jan 2003 : 1000 (no growth applied on the first month of existence))
 *            1 jan 2004 : 900 (growth is -10% as lastly defined in 1 jan 2002, CFG is now at 1 - 10% =  0.9)
 *            1 jan 2005 : 810 (growth is -10% as lastly defined in 1 jan 2002, CFG is now at 0.9 - 10% = 0.81)
