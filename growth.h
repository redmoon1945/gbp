/**
 * Specify Growth, that is, how an amount of money changes over time, in percentage. Growth is always applied on a MONTHLY basis (growth cannot change within a single month).
 * However, for conveniance purpose, growth values are always specified on an "annual base", which means that this class internally convert theses values to monthly
 * basis for calculation purpose.
 * Growth values are internally always defined and persisted as decimal number (qint64), in order to keep an exact representation of the growth value (which is not possible with a double).
 * This means we also need to remember the number of decimals used in the decimal values to convert to nornmal double one.
 * For example, if the qint64 holds 12345, with a no of decimals = 3, it means the value stores represents exactly 12.345 %.
 * Growth is always applied on Day 1 of the month concerned.
 * There are 2 options available to define a growth pattern :
 * -> CONSTANT GROWTH : A constant annual growth value, that applies to past, present and future.
 * -> VARIABLE GROWTH : A set of (date, annual growth change value) that defines CHANGES in annual growth rate through time.
 *    Initial growth change value before the oldest dates defined is 0 (meaning no change).
 *    Each time a new (date, growth change value) is defined, it changes the current "growth" factor by the
 *    given percentage and become the new monthly growth value, to be applied every month. For example, if one has 10%
 *    monthly growth (so a multiplier of 1.1) and then a new ( a date, -10%) is defined (0.9 multiplier), then, from now on,
 *    the new monthy growth will be -0.01% (multiplier = .99)
